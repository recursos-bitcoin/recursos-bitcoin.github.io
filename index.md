**Resumen para vagos:** Lee [El patrón Bitcoin][bitcoin-standard] y [La Tesis Alcista de Bitcoin][bullish-case-book].

## Esenciales

Para entender Bitcoin, tendrás que leer un libro o dos. Si solo quieres 
leer un libro, la mayoría de la gente recomendará **[El Patrón Bitcoin][the-bitcoin-standard]** 
de Saifedean Ammous, y con razón. Bitcoin es dinero, por lo que entender 
[La Ética de la Producción Monetaria][the-ethics-of-money-production] es fundamental para comprender
de qué trata Bitcoin. Si necesitas un curso intensivo en economía, lee [La Economía en una Lección][economics-in-one-lesson] 
de Henry Hazlitt.

If you prefer a shorter introduction, read and listen to the following:

- [La Tesis Alcista de Bitcoin][bullish-case-book] de Vijay Boyapati
- [The Stories We Tell About Money][aantonop-stories] by Andreas Antonopoulos

Further, everyone who is serious about trying to understand Bitcoin should start
at the beginning, and read -- or at least skim -- the 8 pages which gave birth
to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto

## Articles

Many amazing articles have been written about Bitcoin. Trying to
link to all of them is futile. The following is an effort to highlight
at least some of them. For a more comprehensive list of resources please
refer to the literature listed at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute][sni] and the
selection of articles read by [Bitcoin Audible][guy-episodes].

One of the best articles to read if you are new to Bitcoin is [La Tesis Alcista de Bitcoin][bullish-case], which outlines why there are very good reasons to be
optimistic about Bitcoin's future.

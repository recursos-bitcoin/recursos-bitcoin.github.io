## How to Create Your Own

This project is [free and open-source][license], which means that you can clone
it and modify it as you wish. It's just a bunch of text in markdown files and a
bunch of links, so creating a translation is not rocket science. It's mostly
grunt work.

[license]: https://github.com/bitcoin-resources/bitcoin-resources.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE

Here's the gist of it:

1. [Fork the repo][fork]
2. Install [Jekyll][jekyll] and [run your fork locally][run]
3. Translate stuff & link to translations
4. Optional: get yourself a nice domain
5. Set up [GitHub pages][gh-pages]

Of course, you can use other git-centric tools and other Jekyll hosts---you
don't have to use GitHub or their pages feature.

If you don't know what a fork is, read
